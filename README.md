# Cross Platform Tools for C/C++ Extensible Applications

By: Christian Gunderman

## Linux Prereqs:

You must first install GCC, CMAKE, GIT. On Ubuntu and Debian based systems,
build-essential, git, and cmake packages should be adequate.

## Windows Prereqs:

You must first install Visual Studio 2017 + VC++, Git, and CMake tools for
windows to build natively for Windows.

To build and test Linux bits on Windows using the Windows subsystem for Linux,
enable the subsystem, and then run BuildSelfTestUbuntuForWindows.cmd
